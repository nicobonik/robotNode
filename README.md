# RobotNode
node app for a lil robob i'm building during quarantine. His name is Finley and I love him very much. Also, he "bytes" so be careful :)

# Finley
Finley is a 3 wheel differential drive robot with 2 motors and a ball caster wheel out the back. The motors have a secondary shaft with neodymium magnets and an analog hall effect sensor as an encoder setup. I made him to test out my autonomous control systems, but he can also be tele-operated.

## Parts List
Finley is about $80 to $150 to build, depending on how much stuff you already have.
